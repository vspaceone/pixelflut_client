This is a client for the pixelflut server [https://github.com/defnull/pixelflut](https://github.com/defnull/pixelflut). It got two main features:
+ getting the current visualized image (due to the super slow protocol better only get every fourth pixel and interpolate)
+ setting images in various modes
